<h1>What photos can you expect?</h1>
<p>
  There is no garuantee that you will get a shot like each of these, but there is a very good chance you can get the ones you really like.
  Talk to me before the dive if there are any particular shots you would like to get.
  I normally use at least 2 different camera systems, but can only carry one at a time,
  so it helps me to plan camera changes if you let me know which shots you like best.

    <h2>Entry animated gif</h2>
    <p>These are usually easy to get, as long as you wait for me to get into the water first. Make sure you step in on the count of 3..

    <h2>Over-Under portrait</h2>
    <p>Not so easy to get. Sometimes they work, often they don't. Getting the 2 parts of the picture lined up and in focus is really quite a random affair. I will usually shoot quite a few and hopefully get one good one.

    <h2>Surface Portrait</h2>
    <p>Easy to get if the conditions are ok and we aren't in too much of a hurry to start our descent. Best done before I swap to the big camera.

    <h2>Underwater Portrait</h2>
    <p>Easy to get even if the conditions are terrible.
      This one was taken in the worst visibility ever seen here.
      It was less than 1m that day. The hardest part was staying in contact. Shortly after I took this shot I did a loop to get a better angle and couldn't find the diver again...
