# Customer-Photos

Scripts to export photos to soulflyer.com so customers can access them online. 

## build-gallery-page.sh

This  builds static html pages from the pictures currently selected in Aperture. This is done using the "pic-pathnames.scpt" script to set variable PICTUREFILES. There is currently no option to override this but it would be easy to modify.
