  <h2>Electric Nose</h2>
  <p>Electric nose is the most remote site regularly dived in Nha Trang. Its not accessible if the weather is bad, as the local boats are not up to the journey unless the sea is calm. Electric nose sits out in the open sea, exposed to wind and weather from the North and the South.</p>
  <p>Although it is possible to conduct courses here under the right conditions, its general only visited by advanced divers. The sea bed around the site is at 30 to 45 metres.</p>
  <p>Most of the site is wall diving, with occasional swim thrus and some of the most spectacularly colourfull coral. Its also the site where there is the biggest chance of seeing some of the more exotic rarities that are present in Vietnamese waters.</p>
