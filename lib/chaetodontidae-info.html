  <h2>Butterfly fish</h2>
  <p>There are many different species of butterflyfish in the waters around Nha Trang and the rest of Vietnam.
Pictured here are members of the genus chaetodon, the largest genus in the order Chaetodontidae. There are at least 14 Chaetodon species native to Vietnam.</p>
<p> Some of these like Chaetodon ornatissimus and Chaetodon xtrifasciallis are common and likely to be seen on almost every dive in Vietnamese waters. Others, like Chaetodon kleinii and Chaetodon unimaculatus are rarer and only occasionally spotted.</p>
<p> All of these live and breed on the reef. They are rarely seen away from the coral, and almost always seen in pairs. The story is, they mate for life. They certainly form strong pair bonds.</p>
