<h2>Downloading</h2>
  </p>
Click the download link and you should get a zip file containing all the pics on the page.
This probably isn't going to work on a phone without some fancy app (and a jailbroken phone), but it should work fine from a computer.
This may take a little while, the pics are reasonably large.
 If for some reason you need an even higher res copy get in touch.
This is rarely worth the long upload/download time unless you are planing on printing huge copies.
